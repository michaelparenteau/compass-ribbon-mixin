## compass-ribbon-mixin

This is just a simple implementation if a mixin using compass to make a ribbon UI element. You can set the direction, the thickness, color (gradient is generated off a single color) and then you need to set the notch color.

The demo has a simple implementation. The box with the rainbow of ribbons is poorly implemented. I would not do that in a production scenario as every time you call the mixin, it generates all that code. I will refactor later... for now.. the mixin can be played with and might be improved upon.

## What this site is built with

* [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) - A sinatra app, using the rack and bundler install
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org) - Compass is awesome!
* [scss](http://sass-lang.com/) - SCSS.. life is good.

The big giant font comes from [losttype.com](http://losttype.com). It was designed by [Dan Gneiding](www.grayhood.com/) and I think it is beautiful.

Thanks for playing along!
